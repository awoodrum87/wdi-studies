I learn best with a hands on approach. Either Watch and then do or learn as I do something new with a mentor guiding me along. I don't do well when I am required to do a lot of reading and abstract comprehension - I NEED to do it.

Walking through the git fork, clone, add, commit, push and pull in class while actually doing it was really helpful. I feel as up to speed as possible at this stage in the class.

The least effective resources were the two interactive git practices in the study last night. The first one was complete review, but it also contradicted what we were told in class. An example: the interactive review instructed us to use <git commit -m "check in comments"> which we know from class is not how we do check in comments going forward. It also told us what to type which was not helpful.

I think I am OK for the basic fork, clone, add, commit, push, pull functions. I am pretty fuzzy on the branch management approach, but I think I will get up to speed with some practice.

I'm sure I will have more, but I asked all my questions yesterday. :)
